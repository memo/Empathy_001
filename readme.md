# Dependencies
Written in C++ built on [openFrameworks](https://github.com/openframeworks/openframeworks)
(current version built with v0.8.4)

Should work on any system that supports openFrameworks, but tested on OSX 10.9.5

The videos have been omitted from this repo as they were very large. The two videos are loaded from:

- bin/data/videos/test.mp4	// the test video triggered when 't' is pressed
- bin/data/videos/Empathy_001.mov	// the main video

**Update**: Uses CGWarpMouseCursorPosition to set mouse position (to reset mouse to center before data capture). This will only work on OSX. This is not critical behaviour so can be commented out.
